Submissions is in `submissions.zip`. It is a compressed file.

We used two notebooks: `preprocessing.ipynb` and `model.ipynb`. In the first notebook, we pre-processed the data and created 2-word phrases for each tweet that we would use as features. In the second notebook, we normalized the data and then implemented an ANN and Logistic Regression on the training data. We then created predictions for the `contestant_judgement.csv` file and put that in `submissions.zip`.
